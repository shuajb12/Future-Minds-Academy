        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
        will
        give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
        truth,
        <img src="./monkey.jpg">
        the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
        pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that
        are
        extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
        because
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
        pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
        obtain
        some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
        has
        no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? the master-builder of
